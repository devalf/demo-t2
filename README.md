# Demo

### Complex code source to provide a demonstration of skills and code samples.

```
Please consider this code base as outdated and not supported anymore. 
But it still demonstrates my skills and code style, and many of them are still relevant.
Fresh code samples you can find in my other repositories such as 'demo-t3'.
```

Here you can find using the next technologies stack combined to provide a single application.
They are Docker, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Redux, MongoDB, TypeScript, related tools, and libraries.

**To run the service**

Please copy root file `.env.example` to `.env`, fill the variables with necessary values.
Then in the project directory run command

`docker-compose up --build`

wait for a while for running all necessary processes. Then open in the
browser [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or use your own port value if set it in `.env`) to load the
Application.

To run dev version of the project, execute the following command  
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
